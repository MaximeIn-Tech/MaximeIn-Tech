## 🧑‍💻 About Me

🤓 I am **Maxime Hamou**, a former networking IT turned personal trainer turned back into IT professionnal! After 3+ years working in the web3/blockchain industry, I am now transitioning into data science!

🧑‍💻 I love learning and building some cool stuff. I have built multiple Telegram bots and also some personal dashboards. I like experimenting with new technologies and ways to ease my and others life.

🤿 Outside my love of tech, I enjoy **learning new skills**. I have been doing scuba diving for a while, I'm learning leatherwork and also martial arts!

🪙 I have an immense attraction to **economics** and everything **finance**, especially **personal finances**.

📚 I love learning and reading. I read a variety of books, ranging from fantasy books to self-development and financial books. My best recommandations would be:
* "The Stormlight Archive" series by Branson Sanderson | Fantasy novels
* "The Psychology of Money" - Morgan Housel | Finance
* Musashi's Books - Eiji Yoshikiwa | History/Fiction

🚐 I also love to travel. I have visited a lot of Europe's countries (**Spain, Italy, England, France**) and I aspire to make a big van trip to discover more of Europe's gems.

🦙 Finally, I absolutely adore **alpacas**. They are so cute and it's my mission to spread alpaca love!

_P.S: This GitHub account is new hence the lack of a lot of commits. Rebranding my old one would have made a mess..._
